My name is Jonathan Lee. I work full time at CBS Interactive on a variety of their sites. My area of focus for work is around performance, workflow, and deployment strategy.

When Iâ€™m not working I like to tinker with IoT and attempt to make my home smart. If I need a break from either of those I enjoy lifting weights and traveling.
